## Introduction to Problem or Opportunity
Banking sector is a booming industry where it earns most of its profits from interest on the loan they assign. And computers nowadays are intelligent enough to perform nearly all human tasks. In light of this, we are currently training a model to know if a customer is likely to get a loan approval or not. For this, we have gathered data from websites like google, kaggale and UCI merged them into one depending on the features that are relevent for us to work on. We will use different classification algorithms employing techniques like standardization, feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and modeling  to arrive at our solution and identify which one (algorithm) gives us the maximum accuracy

## Research Question
* Extract features/variables which actually decide if the loan can be sanctioned or not, other than the Property_Area?
* Which classifier or algorithm will provide the maximum accuracy amongst all.

This dataset contains over 1,000 records including variables like Loan_ID,	Gender,	Married	Dependents,	Education,	Self_Employed,	ApplicantIncome,	CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount,	Loan_Amount_Term,	Credit_History, Property_Area	and Loan_Status. Here, "Loan_Status" is the target variable

## Future Work
* Verifying if the person has given all the correct information to the bank.
* Identify the amount of risk that bank will incurr if loan is approved.
* If provided with more in depth details like credit and debit history the project can be elevated to another level of data exploration.
