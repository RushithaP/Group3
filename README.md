## Introduction to Problem or Opportunity
The banking sector is a booming industry where it earns the majority of its profits from interest on the loan they assign. And computers nowadays are intelligent enough to perform nearly all human tasks. In light of this, we are currently training a model to know if a customer is likely to get loan approval or not. For this, we have gathered data from websites like Google, Kaggle and UCI merged them into one depending on the features that are relevant for us to work on. We will use different classification algorithms employing techniques like standardization, feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and modeling  to arrive at our solution and identify which one (algorithm) gives us the maximum accuracy
### Targeted Audience: 
This will be beneficial for anyone planning to provide financial services, as we aim to automate the process of determining and predicting a customer's eligibility in advance. As a result, the level of risk that the investor will face will be reduced to some extent in this domain.

## Research Question
The outcome of the project is whether or not the loan is sanctioned after considering all the records of a particular person. Loan sanction depends on income, age, qualification, the purpose of taking loan. Since we are using other variables to describe the outcome i.e., with the help of income we are predicting if we get the loan or not. So we are performing a predictive analysis here.
* Extract features/variables which will decide if the loan can be sanctioned or not, other than the Property_Area?
* Which classifier or algorithm will provide the maximum accuracy amongst all.

## Data Resources

https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data <br>
This dataset contains over 1,000 records including variables like Loan_ID,	Gender,	Married	Dependents,	Education,	Self_Employed,	ApplicantIncome,	CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount,	Loan_Amount_Term,	Credit_History, Property_Area	and Loan_Status. Here, "Loan_Status" is the target variable. We are trying to merge all the above data into one dataframe and then perform traing and testing to predict the target variable. 

## Future Work
* Verifying if the person has given all the correct information to the bank.
* Identify the amount of risk that the bank will incur if loan is approved.
* If provided with more in-depth details like credit and debit history the project can be elevated to another level of data exploration.
